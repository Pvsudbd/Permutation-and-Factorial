# Permutation-and-Factorial
Make with Golang
Create a function to calculate the factorial and permutation values. Then, write a program that takes input from the user, calls the functions, and displays the results on the screen.
The input consists of two integers, x and y.
The output consists of three values:
x! (factorial of x)
y! (factorial of y)
Permutation:
If x â‰¥ y, calculate x permutation y.
If x < y, calculate y permutation x.
